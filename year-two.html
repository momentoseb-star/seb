                    <h2>Brief</h2>
                    <p>To address the growing challenge of urban buildings becoming hotter due to climate change, creating more sustainable homes. This can involve designing homes with energy-efficient materials, incorporating natural ventilation systems, using renewable energy sources like solar power, and integrating green roofs or walls to reduce heat absorption. Smart building technologies, like energy management systems and adaptive shading, can further enhance comfort while lowering energy consumption. These strategies help mitigate urban heat islands and contribute to a more sustainable, livable urban environment.</p>
                    <h2>Developement</h2>
                    <p>i will start my work by researching heat island effect and researching how my idea will work and how it will be funded</p>

                    <h1>What is the urban heat island effect?</h1>
                    <h2>Why does it happen?</h2>
                    <p>The sun's heat reaches rural areas in the city in the same way. The difference between these two is how the environments absorb the heat if travelling to a rural area you will see that it is probably covered in lants, plants take up water and store it in there stems and leaves which eventually turn into water vapour and is released into the air and acts as a natural air conditioner</p>
                    <h2>What do urban materials do?</h2>
                    <p>Materials such as asphalt, steel and brick often have dark colours and dark objects absorb all light energy wavelengths and turn it into heat, so the buildings get warm.  To cool down urban heat islands cities are lightening the streets by covering them in a grey reflective coating as well as planting gardens on urban rooftops that can help bring down the heat.Many urban building materials are impervious meaning water can't flow through these surfaces and without a cycle of evaporating water these surfaces have nothing to cool them down.</p>
                    <h2>What does it mean?</h2>    
                    <p>Urban heat islands are one of the easiest ways to see how human impact can change our planet for the worse. After all, sidewalks, parking lots and skyscrapers wouldn't exist if humans were there to build them. And although these structures are essential to city living, the heat islands they create can be dangerous for humans and harms millions every year and its getting increasingly worse.</p>

                   <h1>Research the effects of plants in cities</h1> 
                   <p>There is an effect in cities called the urban heat island effect and according to the Guardian it raises temperatures by around 2-3 degrees because the sun rays are absorbed by the roads roofs and surfaces in the city making it uncomfortable for millions across the globe and causing an increasing number of deaths

                    Some cities are acting based on scientific information and advice and to combat this they have been planting trees in urban areas and replacing tarmac with grass wherever they can, painting buildings white also has been helping cities reflect the sun.
                    
                    Vegetation that also surrounds the city also makes a difference to the temperature in the city center as well, thus increasing parks and more residential areas will not only benefit the environment for the people but It will also reduce the heat generated from Absorbtion.
                    
                    The article by Happy house plants also talks about how plants increase the air quality in houses, but I assume this also is a factor when it comes to air quality for residents in the city itself and reduces humidity, which improves both living quality and the structural integrity of buildings.
                    
                    Adding vegetation to 3D-printed neighborhoods offers many benefits that enhance the environment and the community's well-being. It brightens the area with colour and life, creating inviting spaces that foster connection and life among residents. Environmentally, greenery improves air quality, provides shade to combat urban heat, and supports local biodiversity by attracting wildlife and pollinators. Moreover, green spaces contribute positively to mental health, reducing stress and encouraging outdoor activities which can strengthen the community. Economically, these enhancements can increase property values and attract businesses seeking vibrant, livable rural areas. Ultimately, integrating vegetation is essential for cultivating a healthier, more dynamic urban landscape, that helps both the issue at hand and brings colour and life to the city.

                   <p>Barcelona is fighting against climate change and to do this they are making cooling shelters; Barcelona has started implementing cooling shelters starting from the schools or known in their country as Reufugis cliámtics a les escoles {cooling shelters for schools} as the name implies, they want to put climate adaptation practice in schools first.

                    They received 4 million euros grant and has been carried out from 2019 to 2022. The participants as listed on the website include ''Barcelona City Council, the Barcelona Education Consortium, Barcelona Cicle de l'Aigua SA (BCASA), the Agència de Salut Pública de Barcelona (ASPB), the ICTA-UAB, ISGlobal and the Vila Olímpica school, in addition to other departments within Barcelona City Council such as the Institut Municipal d'Educació [Municipal Institute of Education] (IMEB) and the Energy Agency''.
                    
                    Barcelona city has approved in 2023 of changing part of their factory into a vibrant urban space with a mix of community aspects Aswell as productive functions inside as a part of a superblock plan in the city aimed at revitalizing the greenery in the city, more than half of the Mercades Benz site will be dedicated public space with a third of it reserved for green areas. The central area will be transformed into a social hub while a large urban park with two gardens and a plaza to boast will be created Aswell. The streets will be designed to create vehicle free spaces to encourage walking and cycling.

                    <p>Biophilic design is a concept in the building industry to increate occupant connections to the natural environment purpose of this is to create a connection between people and nature.​

                        It's about designing living and working environments with the love of nature in mind, it's about finding ways to purposefully create a connection between people and nature when designing buildings, the whole point in biophilic designs is to bring nature inside and outside of your home or buildings.​
                        
                        There are specific buildings built with biophilic design in architecture both with interiors and exteriors​
                        
                        One of the best places for biophilic design is Singapore:​

                    <p>Milians il bosco verticale( the vertical forest) is a new approach to high-rise blocks, in which the architect wanted humans and trees to coexist in an increasingly crowded and polluted city, according to a website dedicated to architecture this provides equivalent greenery without expansion of the city.His vision was to make urban housing that is also an ecosystem improving the quality of life for the residents and city.  The vertical forest consists of two residential towers and is covered with over 9000 trees over 500 shrubs and 11000 plants.​

                        A massive benefit of Bosco Verticale building is its ability to help improve air quality as well as making the urban environment healthier and regulate the building's temperatures for summer, the trees on the building help retain heat inside for winter acting as natural insulation and providing shade for summer.</p>

                    <p>London's Kings Cross is one of London's largest and most successful redevelopments, what was once an underused industrial site is now squares parks and homes and many more, there are tons of parks and open space in Kings Cross that is traffic free, he creation of car-free zones and traffic-reduced spaces has further supported the environmental goals of the redevelopment. By prioritizing walking and cycling, King's Cross encourages sustainable transport while also reducing emissions. This approach is part of a broader strategy to make the area a model of sustainability,kings cross is a green oasis in the middle of London with its parks and landscaped gardens, with a canal going through the middle splitting it apart, there is 26 acres of open space and seven new parks and squares have been built, over 400 mature trees planted around it Aswell, overall a massive success helping to bring down emissions Aswell as bringing shade and helping with summer heat,its contribution to making London greener, more livable, and more sustainable. ​</p>

                    <h1>London's own Growth Plan</h1>

                    <p>London has recently implemented several green redesign initiatives throughout London to  convert to a more sustainable eco future. These are part of a broader plan to make London a  net zero city (which means a city must all together collectively reduce emissions to zero    and stop doing practices that generate greenhouse gases) by 2030, focusing on decarbonizing    infostructures with improvements to energy efficiency and promoting green transport.​</p>

                    <p>Green finance fund: the mayor of London has launched a 500 million fun to support    projects that improve energy efficiency and promote more renewable energy and clean    transportation. Earlier projects include solar plans on London stadium and replacing   streetlights with LEDs, which is projected to save thousands Tonnes of CO2</p>

                    <p>Cool streets and green programs: This program targets climate change with green spaces   planting more trees in the street and introducing sustainable drainage systems, it also aims  to reduce urban overheating by creating shaded routes and heat-resistant trees turning the   grey streets of London green biodiverse places.</p>

                    <p> London green deal: a 10-million-pound initiative focuses on reducing carbon emission while creating thousands of green jobs. This plan introduces decarbonizing homes and supporting small and medium-sized green business enterprises, as well as promoting clean transport solutions like cycling and electric vehicles.</p>

                    <h1>Project Location and my idea</h1>
                    <p>The Location I have chosen to bring my idea to life is London, I was thinking of an area such as Brixton, a city that holds personal significance for me. Growing up in multiple flats which are usually dull and grey, I realize the unique challenges posed by the compact nature of the urban environment. The flat buildings are often tightly packed next to each other this proximity of the buildings creates congestion as well as helps to increase the temperatures in that area through summer, I have developed an ambition to add greenery to these residential areas by incorporating plants in an irrigation system growing on the side of the flats.​

                        The idea of integrating plants into the flat goes beyond aesthetic appeal. Urban areas like London are suffering from rising temperatures due to the urban island effect, as I researched. Additionally with pollution levels in London consistently rise and this will also help tackle that issue as plants act as natural air purifiers.​
                        
                        I want to use a trickle irrigation system on very easy to incorporate plants such as ivies or wall shrubs and place them on balconies or blank sides of flats and make London a greener and more comfortable place to live.​
                        
                        The area I chose is called Tulse hill estate in Brixton which is a housing block, I have chosen this location as there have been demands in the past from residents to improve the way of living in this area with mold growing and roofs decaying and I thought I could give it a entire facelift by adding plants to these buildings which should help with humidity and keeping mold out of these flats, I imagined adding greenery in areas such as this throughout London would help with the heat problems, the flats are not as large as some of the high-rise flat blocks, but I assumed that my idea of running greenery along walls can be enlarged on a larger scale on bigger buildings.​
                        
                        This is the demands of the flat block ive chosen for renovations​</p>

                <H1>Research on irrigation systems and vertical gardens​</H1>
                <P>​

                    There are many types of vertical gardens ranging from hanging pots to plants growing off a wall or a fence or what I want to use for my idea is a green wall this is also known as a living wall and it’s a self-sufficient garden structure that is attached to a wall and receives moisture by a built-in drip irrigation system instead of soil, this style of  vertical planting can be a more expensive option.​
                    
                    The way I would tackle watering the plants on the side of the building is a system known as drip irrigation, a drip irrigation system for a living wall doesn't need anything expensive either to run just some tubing's and fitting and a tripper for each pocket of wall. Most living walls can be irrigated very inexpensively with high quality drip irrigation parts and components.​
                    
                    This doesn't come with all its benefits as living organisms and unwanted insects can inhabit living walls, but this can easily be counteracted by ladybugs.​
                    
                    The diagram on the side explains and shows how the system would work on the wall itself and how it would slowly drip water on the roots of each plant on the wall.</P>

For this project, however, the choice was made to use Acorus, a species known for its excellent adaptability to vertical gardens and its resilience during colder periods excellent for England and its harsher winters.​

                This grass typically grows to a maximum height of 35 cm and produces small non noticeable flowers that are not frequently seen. It is slow yet steady, making it a low-maintenance option for gardeners for it not needing to be pruned as often.​

                Caring for Acorus Gramineus is straightforward. Annual pruning is sufficient to manage its growth and ensure the plant remains healthy and compact within the vertical garden. Additionally, it is highly resistant to pests and diseases, making it an ideal choice for environments where maintenance needs to be kept to a minimum, eg the sides of the flats. its ability to thrive in temperate and cooler climate makes it well-suited to urban landscapes, especially for vertical gardens, where space and resources will be limited. It’s a south or west-facing plant however it’s a very sturdy plant being able to be grown in clay and needs full sun which will be all right as I plan on having it on the exterior of the building ​
                <h2>Heuchera 'Obsidian' (alum root)</h2>
                <p>The colour of this plant if black and red and the foliage of its leaves grows all year round, it is an amazing plant for living walls seeing how sturdy it is, the plant can grow with full sun or partial shade Aswell as it can grow facing any side with full or partial sun.​

                    To look after this plant its quite simple it only requires a little pruning of the flower stems and dry leaves​
                    
                    It does not exceed any higher then 40 cm in height and it forms in a dense clump of leaves​ making it quite good for being used on green walls.</p>

                <h1>How will I get funding for the program​</h1>
                <h2>Council and Government Grants:​</h2>
                <p>I plan on raising a meeting with the council and government, this won't be too hard due to be the mayor of London who has launched a 10-million-pound fund to support            on initiatives that reduce carbon emissions, the plan is to decarbonize homes and support smaller eco companies such as mine. My initiative as a critical step toward       reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability in local communities with the urban heat island effect, will focus on presenting how my project fits within the          government's agenda for a greener city. The focus will be on the impacts such as how cost- effective this initiative will be well as emphasizing how renovating a          unnatractive block of flats both esthetically and environmentally provides many benefits towards both the community and enviroment. These projects could open new job      opportunities for sustainable projects that the government is looking for and this could endorse other stakeholders to invest into the program. ​</p>
                <h2>Resident Contributions:​</h2>
                <P>Additionally, I plan to advocate for people living in flats and apartments across london by devising an app that will offer tangible benefits for those people living under the roofs of these new renovated flats, this app will operate on a points-based system, like cashback models' shops use, where residents will earn points every month for living there as well as looking after the plants that will be growing on their walls and balconies. These points can be redeemed for discounts and vouchers for transport with trains, buses and other services. This initiative not only incentivises a greener city but also helps the residents living there with cheaper living.​

                There will be funds that I could put into place to help fund this program to benefit all members of London in the future. This addition emphasizes how the app would work as a community-based solution to sustainability while engaging residents.​</P>

                <p>
                    My idea was to create a rewards app to give people who decide to live in biophilic flats, these rewards would benefit the tenants of these flats with benefits that can be used for travel around London with buses, trains, and parking in London. I also want to seamlessly make it so these points can be converted to an oyster card.​
                    I want it to be a more environmental version of cashback when shopping to boost people to want to live in places like this. I also wanted the app accessible to people who aren't living in these flats, with news about other environmental initiatives happening around London as well as any offers going on around London.​
                    Logging in and doing an activity the app gives you would give bonus points.

                <h1>UX design Jakobs law​</h1>
                <p>Jakob's Law is a principle of user experience (UX) design, named after Jakob Nielsen, a well-known usability expert. The law states:​</p>

                "Users spend most of their time on other websites, so they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know."​
                
                <h4>Key Takeaways:​</h4>
                
                Consistency in design: Users expect websites and apps to follow familiar patterns they've encountered elsewhere. When designers follow standard conventions, it reduces     the user's cognitive load, helping them navigate and interact more efficiently.​
                
                Reduce the learning curve: If a website behaves in unexpected ways, users may become frustrated. By adhering to common design standards, designers can make it easier   for users to understand and use the site without needing to relearn new patterns.​
                
                Familiarity breeds comfort: People are more likely to engage with and trust a site that feels intuitive because it aligns with their past experiences. Following    familiar design patterns (like where the navigation bar or search function is placed) enhances the overall user experience.​
                
                <h4>Application in UX:​</h4>
                
                <p>Designers often apply Jakob's Law by leveraging widely accepted design elements, such as placing navigation menus at the top or on the left side, using consistent  icons (like a magnifying glass for search), and following other standard user interface (UI) conventions. This approach helps meet user expectations and improves    usability.​</p>
                
                In short, Jakob's Law emphasizes designing for user familiarity, ensuring ease of use by following established standards.

                <h1>conclusion</h1>
                <p>This is my app prototype in motion it's still in the very early stages but I tried my best to make the outcome look as similar as I could with the wire- frames and include some of the original features I wanted in my original low-fidelity ideas, whilst making the app I thought about adding a section talking about how we use the data collected across the city and from the people living around the city as a piece of mind for the users of the app as I wanted to be transparent through the app with its features and how it works and what it does to benefit the user as it’s a rewards program, the rewards section does not show this yet in the early development of this app but I wanted to increase the contribution by getting extra points for trimming the plants in your section yourself further reducing council costs and giving you a healthy handful of extra points,i think as a whole this app has come together quite nicely and its what i orignally imagined when creating it, if i had more time i would look into other features and accesibilty options to add to the application.​</p>

Although it's not directly related to STEM, Coca-Cola has been consistently advocating for diversity and inclusion through its branding and advertisements for many years. In fact, I’ve researched the company’s efforts in this area before and found that they have a strong commitment to representing and including people from diverse backgrounds.​

                My plan is to use this brand as an example to showcase how their dedication to diversity and inclusion could serve as an example, especially within educational environments. By aligning our initiatives with companies like Coca-Cola that prioritize these values, we can demonstrate that creating inclusive spaces could help push forwards diversity in motorsport and across all stem subjects. If we can bridge this gap,highlighting Coca-Cola’s approach and linking it to educational initiatives, we could make a compelling case for embracing diversity and inclusion as foundational values, not only in corporate branding withing the guidlines but also in shaping the future of education.​</P>

                <h1>Coca-Cola Brand Guidlines</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 19px">The reason I've chosen Coca-Cola, even though it's quite different from RC's vision, is because Coca-Cola has been championing diversity for years. A great example is their Christmas campaign, where they convey the message that anyone can be Santa, showing inclusivity and a broad appeal. I want to incorporate that same spirit into my own storytelling and the logos I create.

                    Additionally, Coca-Cola is known for its consistent and recognizable brand identity. No matter what new drink they release, the logo stays the same, with just small changes in color or composition to represent different aspects of the brand. This approach really speaks to me, and I plan to use a similar idea for RC Vision, where the brand will have four distinct parts, each tied together by a cohesive identity but with its own unique twist.​</p>

                <h1>Cokes typography structure</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 19px">I really admire how Coca-Cola uses typography throughout their brand. The way they keep it consistent across so many different products really helps tie everything together and makes the entire brand feel cohesive. What stands out to me is how the text is versatile—it can be scaled or adjusted in boldness, but still maintains that strong, recognizable identity.

                    This iconic typeface has become so closely linked with Coca-Cola that it's instantly recognizable in all their advertising and marketing. Whether it's on a bottle, in a commercial, or on a poster, the way they use typography is a key part of their branding. I think it's a great example of how something as simple as type can play such an important role in making a brand feel familiar and timeless, while still allowing for small creative changes. It’s this kind of consistency and flexibility that I’d love to bring into my own branding approach when it comes to wanting to attract a certain audience towards the brand.​</p>

          <P style="font-size: 19px">STEM Education at its core simply means educating children in four specific diplines, namley Science,Technologies,Engineering and Maths.
             instead of learning them individually stem combines all four of these to better equip students for careers outside. Stem Education has really been growing 
             especially when it comes to play.

                <h1>Merchandise analysis</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 19px">I put my logos on some merchandise ideas for the client to have a more hands on look of what it would look like physically if he ever decided to use it for such purpose, i made a couple tshirt designs aswell as mugs just as an idea for what they would look like and i think they look pretty good if you compose them right on the merch, i also wanted to try and use our main logo for a buisness card and came up with that idea incorperating the same colour pallete but into a buisness card.
                the merch was a more experimental idea but it think it adds to my thought process of how i wanted to use the logos or give the client ideas of using the logos.

              <h1>Reflection – process, outcomes and future capabilities/opportunities</h1>
              <p style="font-size: 19px">This project has undoubtedly been one of the most challenging experiences for me, mainly due to the broad scope and the unclear direction of the initial brief provided by the client. I struggled to fully understand what the client truly wanted for his brand, which made it difficult for me to work effectively within the group. While the client was fairly responsive at the beginning with requests, I sent to Arriane to send him, as we approached mid-December, communication became sparse, and I received little to no feedback on my ideas. This forced me to make some creative decisions on my own in certain areas of the project.​      
                Eventually, I was able to collaborate with Arianne and develop a solid concept, but early on, my attention was largely focused on the first project task (RSA) I had been assigned. Much of my work was done using Photoshop and Illustrator, as I have a strong understanding of those programs. I also used Adobe InDesign to lay out my brand guidelines which I learned to use from my first year in the uni. Overall, I am very satisfied with the final results, particularly those I developed in Illustrator with Arianne's input. I believe the designs cohesively bring the brand together, especially how the logos tie into the concept of RC cars. The main brand represents the shell of the car, Mini Masters symbolizes the car itself, and King of Clubs embodies the wheels of the vehicle. I also produced merchandise examples with the logos on them to give the client and idea of how they would look if they decided to make any more merch using these logos in the future.​
                
                Despite the challenges, this project was a valuable learning experience and gave me insight into what client work is really like. It was definitely the most stressful project I've worked on so far, even compared to my first year. That said, I hope this collaboration opens the door to more opportunities with the client in the future.​

              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <P style="font-size: 19px">In conclusion, this project has been a true test of my creativity and critical thinking aswell as adaptability, and perseverance. While the unclear brief and lapses in client communication made it more difficult than anticipated, these challenges ultimately helped me grow both as a designer and as a team collaborator. The experience pushed me to make independent decisions and trust my own judgment, while also demonstrating the importance of clear client interactions. Working alongside Arianne, I was able to create a concept and designs that I am proud of, particularly in how the logos and brand elements tie together seamlessly. This project, though stressful at times, provided valuable insights into the realities of client work and I believe it has better prepared me for future projects. I look forward to the potential of continuing to work with this client and applying the lessons learned here to my future projects or clients I work with, the research when looking up what brand guidelines include also got me to investigate new things when creating a brand such as how typography can affect the whole look of the brand and what they are trying to portray, I tried using my own experiances as a leverage to expand my ideas and how I wanted a the slogan of the brand to look like.</P>

            <div class="content-left">
              <p style="font-size: 19px">Another valuable feature that LinkedIn offers is the ability to add a brief personal description or summary at the top of your profile. This section allows you to introduce yourself to anyone who views your page, giving them a quick overview of who you are and what you do/ what you enjoy doing. In my own LinkedIn bio, I took the opportunity to mention what I am currently studying, as well as some of my personal interests and hobbies. This not only helps showcase my background but also gives potential connections a better sense of my personality and passions.

              <p style="font-size: 19px">
                  I started my social media campaign by creating a new Instagram account to showcase my work and build a following. I wanted to create a space where I could share my art and connect with other artists and creatives. I first advertised my profile on my personal Instagram account to drive traffic to my new page of family and friends, encouraging them to follow and engage with my content.With my content i would repost it to my personal accounts stories to share it with family and friends who have yet to follow my account, I also used hashtags related to my work to reach a wider audience and attract new followers who share similar interests. As I continued to post content, I focused on creating high-quality images and videos that showcase my skills and creativity, while also engaging with my audience through comments and making friends with other likeminded artists and creatives on instagram. I also made sure to post consistently, at least once a week, to keep my followers engaged and interested in my work.

              <h2>My Target audience</h2>
              <p style="font-size: 19px">
                  My target audience for my social media campaign is primarily young adults and teenagers who are interested in art, anime, and creative content such as drawings animation/videos and 3d models. I want to reach out to people who share similar interests and passions, as well as those who are looking for inspiration and motivation in their own creative pursuits. By creating content that resonates with this audience, I hope to build a community of like-minded individuals who can support and encourage each other in our artistic journeys which can help inspire me with future content posted on instagram.

              <h2>Experimental posts</h2>
              <p style="font-size: 19px">
                  Before posting content based on my interests i posted a couple moc ups i did on marketing based on coca cola,i created a poster using pictures i did myself, i also created a illustrated poster on top of a coca cola bottle photoshoot and a reel with an animated advert.
                  just for a couple test posts they did very well when it came to engagement and views, i think this is due to the fact that i used a trending hashtags on the reel and the fact that it was a coca cola product which is a well known brand.
              </p>

              <p style="font-size: 19px">
                  I used the website buffer which posted a blog update on thier wesbite for the best times on instagram and i tried sticking with that and it slolwy gained me a couple followers and 100s of views on some of my reels

                  The website buffer highlights that afternoons, particularly the hours when most people finish work, are optimal for posting content on Instagram. This is likely due to increased user activity as individuals unwind and check their social media feeds after a busy day at work or school. By aligning my posting schedule with these peak engagement periods, I was able to maximize the visibility and reach of my content. Additionally, I noticed that posts shared during these times not only garnered more immediate likes and comments but also maintained higher engagement rates over the following days. i would suspect this being the fact that the time alligned with both Europe and the US time zones, which is where most of my audience is from.

              <h1>Conclusion</h1>
              <p style="font-size: 19px">
                  In conclusion, my journey on Instagram has been a valuable learning experience. By analyzing engagement data, experimenting with different content formats, and strategically timing my posts, I was able to grow my audience and enhance my online presence. I look forward to continuing this journey and exploring new ways to connect with my audience. What i learned from this project is video content known as reels on instagram had higher engagment rates from people who saw my content and visited my profile to also liking and following me from the material i created online, whereas my posts had a slower growth rate but it was more consistent with my already current followers and artists who follow and like my work. i also learned that using trending hastags gets your posts and videos recommended to people across the world which got my viewership of my content within 90 days to reach over 2000 views and 100s of likes across my posts and reels.
              </p>

              <P style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">Overall, my experience on Instagram has taught me the importance of adaptability and continuous learning of social media. By staying attuned to trends, engaging with my audience, and refining my content strategy, i do want to continue posting on this now new creative account to showcase my hobbies and have fun as this is something i have been wanting to do for a while but never really got to it. I do want to keep developing my social media skills and posting content onto that instagram and this project will be my first stepping stone into that process.</P>

        </div>
        <div class="year-one-section reverse just-text" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
            <div class="content-left" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px">Introduction</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">This semester, I was tasked with starting my own group project. due to illness during the planning stage, I shifted to working independently on a project based around one of my personal interests, anime. I chose Dragon Ball Daima as the focus, and decided to develop a concept for a new character that episodes would be revolving around, introduced in a potential second season of the show. 

            For this project, I’ve been working on designing the character's appearance, making sure it fits within the existing art style and character design of the series. I’m also exploring how this character would interact with the world and settings already established in Dragon Ball Daima, i will also be creating a backstory and lore behind the characters, and how their presence could impact the storyline. The goal is to create a believable addition to the universe by building out their background, personality, and lore in a way that feels true to the original series while adding something new and bringing the attention off the main z fighters while also including them as part of the crucial story. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Before I started my creation process, i researched my target audience behind the anime, focused and looked into the creation of characters and product behind the anime and looked at how crunchy roll and toei release schedule for the anime.</p>
            <!-- Images go here -->
            <h1 style="font-size: 40px">Target audience</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">I researched the audience behind anime such as dragon ball and When reading one article it says Dragon Ball Daima was designed to appeal to both nostalgic fans who grew up watching Dragon Ball GT and their children. Executive producer Akio Iyoku explained that the goal was to create a family friendly series like dragon ball GT, where parents and kids could enjoy it together. The choice to turn Goku and the cast into kids was meant to broaden the audience appeal, while maintaining an adventure based storyline.​</p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">The article discusses a clarification from the producer of the anime Dragon Ball Daima, Despite initial speculation that the show would be aimed primarily at children due to its portrayal of iconic characters in younger forms, the producer denied these claims. He emphasized and excalims that the anime is intended for fans of all ages, including older audiences who grew up with the franchise. Dragon Ball Daima will maintain the same core elements of action, adventure, and humor that have made the Dragon Ball series popular whilst also retaining the nitty gritty lore and character building.</p>
            <h1 style="font-size: 25px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">In conclusion the animes target audience is:</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Longtime Dragon Ball Fans (Adults from early 30s older and older Teens)</p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">New Generation of Viewers (Kids and Younger Teens)​</p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Global audience of action adventure anime fans</p>

            <h1>Toei animation and how they release anime</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Toei Animation is the studio behind the Dragon Ball anime franchise and is responsible for producing and releasing its content. In Japan, new series like Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super, and various TV specials are first broadcast on television, typically through networks like Fuji TV. Episodes are released weekly, and after airing, they become available on Blu-ray,DVD and CD. Toei also produces theatrical cinema films, such as Dragon Ball Super-Broly and Dragon Ball Super-Super Hero, which premiere in Japanese cinemas before moving to home media and abroad.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Internationally, Toei licenses Dragon Ball content to regional distributors. In North America, companies like Funimation (now part of Crunchyroll) and Crunchyroll itself manage the English dubbing, subtitling, and distribution. Newer content, such as Dragon Ball Super, is often simulcast or made available shortly after its Japanese release, with subtitled versions coming first, followed by English dubs for TV and streaming platforms like Toonami.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Toei also supports digital distribution through major streaming services, including Crunchyroll, Hulu, and Netflix in select regions. Alongside streaming, Blu-ray and DVD box sets are released globally for fans and collectors, japan is huge on cds and dvds. These releases are frequently accompanied by a strong merchandising push, which includes toys, collectable figures, video games, apparel, and promotional events, helping to maintain the franchise’s worldwide popularity.
            </p>

                <h1>Crunchyroll Anime Release Scheduling, Summary of Research</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                    Crunchyroll schedules new anime episodes primarily through simulcasts, which stream episodes shortly after they air in Japan—usually within an hour for premium subscribers. Free users no longer have access to these releases. Crunchyroll does not provide a forward facing release calendar, instead episodes are added to the Release Calendar only after they are live. As a result, users often refer to the previous week’s release time to estimate when the next episode will drop. Release times are typically in Pacific Time and require conversion for other regions. This approach helps Crunchyroll manage anime across all regions they release to, which also takes into account with episode release schedule.

                }
            </style>
            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Concept Design​</h2>
            <li><strong>Collaboration with Licensors</strong>: Bandai works closely with Toei Animation and Shueisha, the companies behind Dragon Ball, to ensure the figures match the official character designs and respect the intellectual property.</li>
            <li><strong>Concept Art</strong>: Artists and designers create detailed concept art for the figure. This includes defining the character’s pose, facial expressions, accessories, and any special features like energy effects or battle damage.​</li>
            <li><strong>Reference Material</strong>: They reference anime/manga frames, 3D models, or other media to ensure accuracy.</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">3D Sculpting and Modeling</h2>

            <li><strong>3D Modeling</strong>: Using software like ZBrush or Maya, artists create a 3D model of the character based on the concept art. This involves sculpting the character’s features, clothing, and accessories in a digital environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Texturing</strong>: Once the 3D model is complete, artists apply textures and colors to the model to match the character’s design. This includes adding details like skin tones, clothing patterns, and other surface details.</li>
            <li><strong>Rendering</strong>: The final step involves rendering the 3D model to create high-quality images or animations for promotional materials and packaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Pose Selection</strong>: At this stage, the team decides on a dynamic or iconic pose for the character. For example, Goku might be sculpted in his Kamehameha pose or Vegeta in a battle-ready stance.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototyping</strong>: A prototype is 3D-printed, allowing the design team to physically inspect the figure and adjust. </li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Approval and Refinement​</h2>
            <li><strong>Licensor Approval</strong>: The prototype is sent for review and approval by Toei or Shueisha. They ensure the figure aligns with Dragon Ball’s official representation.​</li>
            <li><strong>Refinement</strong>: Based on feedback, adjustments are made to improve accuracy, such as tweaking facial expressions, colors, or details like hair spikes or armor pieces.​</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Mold Creation</h2>
            <li><strong>Mold Development</strong>: Once the design is finalized, steel molds are created. These molds are used to mass-produce the figure’s parts, usually made from plastic typically PVC or ABS plastics.</li>
            <li><strong>Precision</strong>: The molds are finely crafted to capture intricate details such as hair strands, facial features, and costume textures and muscle definition.​</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Injection Molding and Casting​</h2>
            <li><strong>Injection Molding</strong>: Molten plastic is injected into the molds to create the figure's individual parts. Each piece is produced separately, such as the head, arms, legs, and any accessories weapons, energy effects.​</li>
            <li><strong>Material Selection</strong>: Different types of plastics or vinyl are used depending on the flexibility and strength required for each part, softer plastic for capes or accessories, harder plastic for structural component.​</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Assembly​</h2>
            <li><strong>Figure Assembly</strong>: After molding, the various parts are carefully assembled by hand or by machines. Some figures have interchangeable parts (for example, different hands or heads), requiring multiple pieces to be joined.​</li>
            <li><strong>Articulation</strong>: If the figure is articulated like the S.H. Figuarts, the joints are designed to allow movement without breaking the sculpt’s aesthetics and silhouette.​</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Painting and Detailing</h2>
            <li><strong>Hand-Painting</strong>: Skilled workers hand-paint the finer details such as facial expressions, shading on muscles, and special effects like, glowing eyes . Automated machines and processes are used for larger or repetitive areas.​</li>
            <li><strong>Color Application</strong>: Advanced techniques like tampo printing or airbrushing are employed for consistent application of colors, particularly for difficult areas like eyes or small accessories.​</li>
            <li><strong>Battle Effects</strong>: Some figures feature battle damage or energy effects, which are often highlighted through specialpaint applications or transparent plastic pieces.​​</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Quality Control</h2>
            <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: Each figure undergoes a quality control process to ensure all parts fit together properly, colors are accurate, and the overall figure meets the desired standards.​</li>
            <li><strong>Test Assembly</strong>: Articulated figures are tested for pose ability, ensuring joints work correctly without being too loose or stiff.</li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Packaging and distribution</h2>
            <li><strong>Box Design</strong>: The packaging is designed with Dragon Ball’s signature aesthetic, often featuring character artwork, logos, and clear windows to showcase the figure inside.​</li>
            <li><strong>Final Inspection</strong>: Before shipping, figures are inspected one final time to check for any
             imperfections in painting or assembly. Approved figures are placed in blister packaging or boxes
               and readied for distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Shipping</strong>: Once packaged, the figures are distributed worldwide to retailers, where they
            are sold to collectors and fans.​</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Editions</strong>: Bandai also releases special editions or premium versions of figures, which
            may include extra accessories, alternative colors, or exclusive packaging.​</li>

                <h1>My very own approach to this project</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 19px;">With this project, I wanted to design and create my own original character, while also diving into 3D modelling to help bring that character to life. This step is crucial in visualising how an anime character would exist in a more developed form aswell as being the basis on how the character would look in the anime and as product on shelves, beyond just concept art. I aimed to explore how the design translates into three dimensions, helping me better understand character form, structure. 

                In addition to the character model, I plan to create a piece of promotional material. similar to what you'd typically see on platforms like Crunchyroll or across social media. This will take the form of a poster that highlights the dynamic between my character and existing ones from Dragon Ball Daima. My focus is on the conceptual side of character and product creation, taking inspiration from how companies like Bandai approach branding and merchandising. I also wanted to explore the storytelling and lore aspect, which plays a major role in how studios like Toei Animation build their narratives and expand their universes. 

                </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 19px">
                    When coming up with the initial design for my character, I was thinking about how the Majin brothers in Dragon Ball Daima didn’t get much spotlight compared to the Z Fighters. For a potential second season, I wanted the focus to shift more toward them. My idea was to introduce a third Majin brother,one who is created at the end of Daima, after the Z Fighters are returned to their original forms,his character focuses on creation and conflict between his identity and the people who his brothers have become.

                    His design was inspired by a fusion of Majin Kuu and Janemba. I studied artwork of both characters and blended elements from each to create a unique, original design that still fits within the visual style of the Dragon Ball universe. The goal was to create a character that felt like a natural addition to the existing lore, while bringing a fresh look and narrative angle to the story.</p>

                <img src="img/first concept 2.jpg" alt="Character concept art of Majin Uuj, side view, showing profile and costume details, neutral expression, set against a plain background" class="swot-img" style="width: 400px; max-width: 45vw; height: auto; display: block;">

                </div>
                <p style="font-size: 19px">This is my first concept for my original character, Majin Uuj. I chose the anime Dragon Ball Daima as the foundation for this project because it really resonated with me. Dragon Ball is an anime I grew up with, and it’s played a big role in shaping who I am today. The series has taught me a lot about resilience, determination, and hard work that I carry with me both personally and creatively. I know many older fans of Dragon Ball feel the same way, which makes this project even more meaningful to me.</p>

These were also used on my own art social media, i rendered this character with 1 to 1 colour accuracy and stylasitation to the show,this piece took me quite awhile to render i worked on it for about 3 days.</p>

                  <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">This is my concept sheet for my original character. I created it to showcase different facial expressions, my chosen colour palette, and a close-up of the cloth piece wrapped around the character’s waist. I wanted to highlight the smaller design details that help bring the character to life. Alongside the concept sheet, I also created a rough test animation to explore how the character might move within the anime world. While the animation is still in an early stage, my main focus was on getting a sense of the character’s scale and presence in motion.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">This is a poster from Dragon Ball Daima. I drew a lot of inspiration from its style, especially in how it uses familiar locations from the anime as part of the composition. I really admire how the poster captures the adventurous tone of this new chapter, and how it features the main characters in a way that instantly gives off that classic Dragon Ball energy. The visual storytelling and vibrant design really stood out to me and influenced me on how I think about layout and character placement in my own work. </p>

                <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">I created this poster in Photoshop, taking inspiration from the style of Dragon Ball Daima’s first official poster. However, I wanted to add my own touch by incorporating the darker shading seen in the anime itself. My vision for this concept was to set a more serious and darker tone for the season,shifting the focus away from Goku and the Z Fighters and instead highlighting the Majin brothers and how that dynamic changed. This change in direction allowed me to explore a new narrative angle while still staying true to the overall aesthetic of the series.

                    <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">This was my first time trying hands on 3D sculpting, and I wanted to bring my character to life by conceptualising a 3D bust. My goal was to see how the design would translate into a more dimensional form, something that could potentially be used for 3D printing a figure in the future. I used ZBrush for the sculpt, and although it was my first experience with the software, I started to get the hang of it after a few hours. I was able to complete the bust, and overall, I’m really happy with the outcome. It gave me a better understanding of form, depth, and how character designs work in a physical space. </p>
                    

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>  
                <P style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">In conclusion, while I initially set out to create custom packaging for my project aswell as a manga panel, unforeseen health limitations and ongoing issues with my Wi-Fi prevented me from bringing that vision to life. Despite these setbacks, I’m proud of what I was able to accomplish. My original character, Majin Uuj, feels fully fleshed out and thoughtfully developed, with a personality and presence that mesh dynamically with the established cast of Dragon Ball Daima. Seeing how well Uuj fits into that world has been deeply rewarding. I'm also extremely pleased with the professional quality of the anime poster I created.It truly captures the tone and energy I was aiming for, and I couldn’t be happier with how it turned out.
                <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Time management was really tought on me this semseter and i tried my best to focus on different aspects of this work without getting drowed out, i managed to do alot of my work in the frist few weeks before i started being addmited to hospital again, i am very happy espeically with the lore i have created behind this character as i feel like this would make a very interesting and compeling character for myself as a dragon ball fan, i have been getting feed back on my work throughtout these months by posting it on my instagram, my dragon ball posts seem to get alot of engagement and when i talk to other artists about it they love the artstyle and direction i took with this characters backstory and how he would interact in the demon realm.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 19px; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">Next year when i get more time on my hands i wish to come back to this project and add more content to it, i have finished my conceptualising but i want to start developing merchandise for this character such as custom illustrated shirts, collectable cards and even packaging for the character as a figure.</p>
